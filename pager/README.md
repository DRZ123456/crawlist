Paginators are divided into static paginators and dynamic paginators. Static paginators can be used to handle non JS driven web pages, while dynamic paginators can be used to handle JS driven web pages. Generally speaking, web pages that static paginators can handle are usually paginated using redirection, and dynamic paginators can also handle them.
